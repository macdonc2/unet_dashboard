# unet_dashboard
A project where I'm building a simple dashboard for unet. The goal is to slowly create an interactive page where anyone can curate data, train a model, and run a prediction using a graphical web interface powered by dash.

# Dependencies
To run this dashboard locally, you will need:
- Anaconda running Python 3.8, with all base packages
- dash by plotly
